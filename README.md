# Cornelius Game Engine

##This is a basic 2D Game engine to develop my C++ Technical skills and knowledge built in.

###Description
A basic 2D game engine that will focus on creating a framework to make it as easy as possible to create 2D games. This will be used as research for me to learn how to make a good game engine framework before moving onto 3D.

###Technologies Used (List may expand as project is developed.):
 - Visual Studio 2022 has been used for development and compilation.
 - SDL was used to load textures for it's wide variety of cross platform support and it's native support to work within C++.

##How to install/run/use this project.
###Installation and setup instructions.
 1. Clone the repository to your machine.
 2. Open the Visual Studio 2022 Solution Named "CorneliusGameEngine.sln".
 3. Set the "CorneliusGameEngineSandbox" project as the startup project.
 4. Ensure the "CorneluisGameEngineFramework" project is set as a dependency of the sandbox project. (This project builds the engine library that the sandbox relies on.)

###How to run the project.
 1. Build the "CorneliusGameEngine" Solution (Both projects will place the output files within the follow directories "projectDir/Configuration/Platform").
 2. Go to the Sandbox project's directory, open the binary folder and locate the generated executable.
 3. Run the generated Executable (You should at minimum be greeted by a console window with any messages that the engine has for you).
